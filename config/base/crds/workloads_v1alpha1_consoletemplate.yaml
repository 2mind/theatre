                      Each element of the array is evaluated against the corresponding
                      element of the console's `spec.command` field. An element consisting
                      of a single `*` character will assert on the presence of an
                      element, but will allow any contents. An element consisting
                      of `**`, at the end of the match array, will match 0 or more
                      additional elements in the command, but can only be used at
                      the end of the rule.  Pattern matching _within_ elements is
                      deliberately not supported, as this makes it much harder to
                      construct rules which are secure and do not allow chaining of
                      additional commands (e.g. in a shell context)."
